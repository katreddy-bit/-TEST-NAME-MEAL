The Meal App is a powerful web application built entirely using vanilla JavaScript to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. One of the main features of this app is the ability to search for food recipes using the Themealdb API, which returns a variety of data related to the searched recipe, such as ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. The app displays this information in an easy-to-read format, making it simple for users to find the recipe they are looking for.

Another key feature of the app is its ability to provide auto-suggestions as users type in the search bar. This feature enhances the user experience and helps users find the recipe they want even faster. Additionally, the app allows users to mark their favorite recipes and save them for future reference. The saved recipes can be easily accessed from the "My Favourite Meals" page, and users can restore them even after reopening the browser.

The Meal App is designed to work seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices, making it easy for users to access the app from anywhere. The use of vanilla JavaScript allows for a lightweight and fast-performing application without the need for any additional JavaScript frameworks. This project is a great addition to your portfolio, showcasing your skills in working with APIs, JavaScript, and web development in general.
